Initializing the backend...

Successfully configured the backend "azurerm"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Error: Terraform encountered problems during initialisation, including problems
with the configuration, described below.

The Terraform configuration must be valid before initialization so that
Terraform can determine which modules and providers need to be installed.


Error: Invalid expression

  on main.tf line 644, in locals:
 644:   _validate_size = local.selected_vm_size != null ? true :
 645:     error("Allowed sizes for '${var.environment}' are: ${join(", ", local.valid_sizes)}")

Expected the start of an expression, but found an invalid expression token.

Error: Argument or block definition required

  on main.tf line 645, in locals:
 645:     error("Allowed sizes for '${var.environment}' are: ${join(", ", local.valid_sizes)}")

An argument or block definition is required here. To set an argument, use the
equals sign "=" to introduce the argument value.
