Initializing the backend...

Successfully configured the backend "azurerm"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Error: Terraform encountered problems during initialisation, including problems
with the configuration, described below.

The Terraform configuration must be valid before initialization so that
Terraform can determine which modules and providers need to be installed.

  on main.tf line 276, in resource "azurerm_key_vault_secret" "github_token":
 276:     ignore_changes = [value],  # Never update the secret after first creation, freeze secret forever

Argument definitions must be separated by newlines, not commas. An argument
definition must end with a newline.
