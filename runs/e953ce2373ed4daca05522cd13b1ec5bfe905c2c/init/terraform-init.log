Initializing the backend...

Successfully configured the backend "azurerm"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Error: Terraform encountered problems during initialisation, including problems
with the configuration, described below.

The Terraform configuration must be valid before initialization so that
Terraform can determine which modules and providers need to be installed.


Error: Unexpected comma after argument

  on main.tf line 275, in resource "azurerm_key_vault_secret" "github_token":
 275:     ignore_changes = [], # Allow rotation, available value will be taken

Argument definitions must be separated by newlines, not commas. An argument
definition must end with a newline.
